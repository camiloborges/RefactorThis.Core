# RefactorThis.Core

This is a response to a code challenge I was presented with.

I received a poorly written .net 4.5 code(not sure which version) and I was asked to refactor it. 
The only thing I've tried to do was to keep endpoint behaviour as original code, which I am unable to test.

There are further oportunities to improve this code but I feel this is a good enough start.

I have commited between 12 and 16hrs to this (on and off).
